 *         Spring Data JPA
 * 
 *         API provides JpaTemplate class to integrate spring application with
 *         JPA.
 * 
 *         JPA (Java Persistent API) is the sun specification for persisting
 *         objects in the enterprise application. It is currently used as the
 *         replacement for complex entity beans.
 * 
 *         The implementation of JPA specification are provided by many vendors
 *         such as: Hibernate, Toplink, iBatis, OpenJPA.
 * 
 *         Advantage : You don't need to write the before and after code for
 *         persisting, updating, deleting or searching object such as creating
 *         Persistence instance, creating EntityManagerFactory instance,
 *         creating EntityTransaction instance, creating EntityManager instance,
 *         commiting EntityTransaction instance and closing EntityManager. So,
 *         it save a lot of code.
